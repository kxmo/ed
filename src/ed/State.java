	 * This class will contain information relating to the state of the program.
	 * This will likely include:
	 * Buffers (past and current)
	 * Commands executed
	 * Global switch commands
	 * 
	 * Potentially a mechanism for dynamically changing the state by called functions
	 * This could be implemented by having a function that can be overridden. 
	 * That function would always be called before the next event was processed.
